# Horiseon Accesibility

## Goals

### This code contains an updated version of accessibility standards in HTML and CSS. The goal is to provide an inclusive environment and optimize the site for search engines. 

## Application

#### The changes I made directly applied to the code structure itself. 
1. The CSS styling was reorganized to match the HTML structure. 
2. Comments were added to both the HTML and CSS documents to allow for a more understandable code to build off in the future.
3. The links were tested and fixed.
4. `alt` comments were added for greater accessibility. 

## Result

Not only is the website more accessible to the user, but the code itself is reformatted to fit the logical structure so that it is more accessible to the coding community.
